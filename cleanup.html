 <p>A clean-up includes deep cleansing, exfoliating, giving steam to the face followed by removing all the whiteheads and blackheads.This typically involves using a variety of skincare products, such as cleansers, toners, and scrubs, to remove dirt, oil, and other impurities from the skin. The goal of a clean up is to leave the skin feeling clean and exfoliated without impurities, and to help improve its overall appearance.</p>
