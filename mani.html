			<p>A manicure and pedicure is a cosmetic nail treatment for the hands (manicure) and feet (pedicure). The hands and feet are scrubbed, clipped, cleaned, filed, cuticle-cleaned and massaged in a process that lasts about an hour.'Manicure' is a treatment that improves the appearance of nails and hands, and softens them, whereas, 'pedicure' has the same impact on feet. Since manicure and pedicure relax the muscles and skin of the hand and feet, respectively, it is important to understand some basics about the anatomy of the hand and feet.</p>
