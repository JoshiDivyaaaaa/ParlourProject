  		<p>Threading is a method of hair removal for both men and women originating in India and Central Asia. It has gained popularity in Western countries, especially with a cosmetic application (particularly for removing/shaping eyebrows). Eyebrow threading.Threading is an ancient form of hair removal that uses a cotton blend thread to remove hair from the follicle. The piece of string is wrapped around a follicle of hair and then twisted until the hair is pulled out to remove the hair.Its effects last longer than waxing, tweezing or shaving and each time you get threaded, the hair grows thinner and finer, more bright and not so visible.
