	<p>Waxing is the process of hair removal from the root by. using a covering of a sticky substance, such as wax, to. adhere to body hair, and then removing this covering. and pulling out the hair from the follicle.A cloth or paper strip is applied and pressed firmly, adhering the strip to the wax and the wax to the skin. The strip is then quickly ripped against the direction of hair growth, as parallel as possible to the skin to avoid trauma to the skin.</p>
